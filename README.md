# A Python and Artificial Intelligence Program / Project

**This is a Python project from my early days as a Computer Science student**

_This programm was created for the eighth semester class Distributed Artificial Intelligence -Intelligent Agents
and is the final project for the class_

> #### Description of project
>
>>A python script that implements a generic planner to solve a series of minigames using heuristic algorithms to generate the best possible moves to reach the goal state.

> #### A generic planner
>
>>A planner generates a sequence of actions so that when the actions are executed the agent's world is found from an initial to a final state. The planner is considered generic when we change nothing in its code to solve different problems.<br>
To generate the sequence of actions the planner uses a search algorithm to construct a search tree. The algorithm A star (A *) was used in this work.

> #### Implemented minigames
>
> 1. Blocks World
> 2. Water Jug problem
> 3. n - Puzzle

> #### About this project
>
> - The comments to make the code understandable, are within the .py archive
> - This project was written in Anaconda's Spyder IDE.
> - This program runs for Python version 2.7
> - This repository was created to show the variety of the work I did and experience I gained as a student
>
